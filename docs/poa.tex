\section{Introduction}
This project is developed for the subject Individual project with the goal to gain insight into the use of utalising the graphical processing unit.
To reach this goal this project consists of a graphical 3D solar system simulator with planet models, lighting models and gravity simulator.
This project is developed using opengl to interface and utilize the GPU.
\subsection{Requirement}
This project will include the following components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 3D models {planets,moons, sun, asteroid}
    \item lighting 
    \item 
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
